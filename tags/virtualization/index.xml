      <description>To enable nested virtualization within a Red Hat Virtualization 4.3 environment, you will need to do two things. First, make sure the ‚Äúvdsm-hook-nestedvt‚Äù package is present on the host hypervisor. You‚Äôll need to restart vdsmd as well after installing.
Second, you‚Äôll need to enable the Pass-Through Host CPU option in the virtual machine settings (under the host section).</description>

      <description>A common task most virtualization administrators will perform is installing the guest agent(s) among their guest VMs. Ansible has a nice module that allows an administrator to automate these common tasks, such as attaching/detaching a CDROM device to a VM, rebooting several VMs, etc. Combining this with ansible‚Äôs management of Windows devices and it makes it fairly trivial to automate a mass installation of guest agents in windows.</description>

      <description>To import virtual machines from a KVM/libvirt hypervisor into Red Hat Virtualization, is pretty easy. RHV will handle the v2v copying for you in the background, there are just a couple prerequisite steps to take prior to importing. On the RHV hypervisor host you‚Äôre proxying the import connection through, setup passwordless SSH from the vdsm user to the root user on the source hypervisor:</description>

      <description>In setting up a local virtualization environment a little while back, I thought I‚Äôd try the recently GA‚Äôd VDO capabilities in the RHEL 7.5 kernel. These include data compression and de-duplication natively in the linux kernel (through a kernel module). This was Red Hat‚Äôs efforts behind the Permabit acquisition. Considering a virtualization data store is a prime candidate for a de-duplication use-case, I was anxious to reclaim some of my storage budget üôÇ .</description>
