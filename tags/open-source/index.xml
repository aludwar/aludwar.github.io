      <description>Recently the merging of Fedora Atomic and CoreOS Container Linux into what is now known as Fedora CoreOS has moved out of preview and is ready for prime time use. I&amp;#8217;ve been running a few small container apps on a Fedora Atomic 28 VM, which is now ripe to be moved into the new replacement Fedora CoreOS.</description>

      <description>To enable nested virtualization within a Red Hat Virtualization 4.3 environment, you will need to do two things. First, make sure the &amp;#8220;vdsm-hook-nestedvt&amp;#8221; package is present on the host hypervisor. You&amp;#8217;ll need to restart vdsmd as well after installing.
Second, you&amp;#8217;ll need to enable the Pass-Through Host CPU option in the virtual machine settings (under the host section).</description>

      <description>As we go further in our efforts to automate all the things with ansible, you will likely come across a need to manage some cusom credentials that do not come with a predefined type in Ansible Tower. You might be currently setting these in an environment variable, in group_vars or host_vars, or perhaps hardcoded into a playbook itself.</description>

      <title>Adding python virtual environments (venvs) to Ansible Tower</title>

      <description>As you&amp;#8217;re developing playbooks you may find that you need to add additional python capability in order to use some modules. These are easy enough to install on a regular linux client with pip, but how does this work for Ansible Tower? Fortunately this is not too different for Ansible Tower, we&amp;#8217;re just going to instruct Tower to add another source directory for our new venvs, and then assign these in Tower at an Organization, Project, or Job Template level.</description>

      <description>Cobbler is a great tool for PXE booting, I&amp;#8217;ve been using it for years in both my personal and professional lives. Occassionally when a new OS comes out, you may find yourself needing to update cobbler&amp;#8217;s distro signatures so it can import a new OS distribution. Thankfully, with their distro signatures being hosted on GitHub, this is really easy to do if your cobbler server isn&amp;#8217;t able to pull the latest signatures on its own.</description>

      <title>Limiting Ansible Tower inventory with Satellite host groups</title>

      <description>When thinking about ingesting systems into Ansible Tower&amp;#8217;s inventory, a common use-case is to intelligently filter hosts into Ansible Tower such that we&amp;#8217;re selectively adding only the hosts we want into Tower inventory. When pairing with Red Hat Satellite, we can use Satellite&amp;#8217;s host grouping feature combined with Ansible Tower&amp;#8217;s Satellite 6 dynamic inventory script to apply this filtering.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to check the supportability of 32-bit applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. RHEL can support 32-bit applications in a 64-bit environment in the following scenarios:
 https://access.redhat.com/solutions/509373  Additionally, with the multilib toolchain, one can install the 32-bit packages by specifying the architecture in the yum install command:</description>

      <description>Recently I was investigating how to connect Ansible Tower to Microsoft Team Foundation Server to source a git repo. To document this for later, I discovered that the way to do this is with an SSH key, and by turning on the SSH service on TFS. Here&amp;#8217;s how I got it working:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed Kyle Rankin&amp;#8217;s writing for the Linux Journal for several years now. Recently, he presented a topic at FOSDEM 2019 covering the current risk of cloud provider lock in where he draws comparison to the proprietary UNIX wars of the 90s and 00s. He highlights linux and open source software&amp;#8217;s immense success during this time, and how everyone benefit from relief of costly proprietary vendor lock-in.</description>

      <description>Recently we had one of the largest and most interesting meetups I think the Calgary market has seen in quite a while. We were able to run an Ansible Workshop, which is a mix of presentation and hands-on lab content. What makes these workshops different (and a reason people love them) is we get to teach a concept, then implement it in a lab.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using a raspberry pi for some occasional tinkering, but have finally found it a more permanent home. I recently got an itch to play some old console games and thought I&amp;#8217;d build a RetroPie. I had all the hardware I needed, but in case you don&amp;#8217;t there are kits available that include everything one needs to get a retro gaming system going.</description>

      <description>Compliance scanning and remediation with Ansible is a common question that comes up. How does Ansible do this? What are its capabilities? Within the Ansible Galaxy community, there&amp;#8217;s been some significant investment in developing ansible roles for security and compliance. I&amp;#8217;ll show you how to download this Ansible role and make use of it within Ansible Tower.</description>

      <description>Okay, I give. I found this tool way too cool not to blog about it. Definitely the most interesting post by Lifehacker in a while. Someone has developed a tool that creates a heat map of your Google location history. Download your data from Google in JSON format, and upload to the tool.</description>

      <title>Using ansible to manage RHV/oVirt</title>

      <description>A common task most virtualization administrators will perform is installing the guest agent(s) among their guest VMs. Ansible has a nice module that allows an administrator to automate these common tasks, such as attaching/detaching a CDROM device to a VM, rebooting several VMs, etc. Combining this with ansible&amp;#8217;s management of Windows devices and it makes it fairly trivial to automate a mass installation of guest agents in windows.</description>

      <description>To import virtual machines from a KVM/libvirt hypervisor into Red Hat Virtualization, is pretty easy. RHV will handle the v2v copying for you in the background, there are just a couple prerequisite steps to take prior to importing. On the RHV hypervisor host you&amp;#8217;re proxying the import connection through, setup passwordless SSH from the vdsm user to the root user on the source hypervisor:</description>

      <description>In setting up a local virtualization environment a little while back, I thought I&amp;#8217;d try the recently GA&amp;#8217;d VDO capabilities in the RHEL 7.5 kernel. These include data compression and de-duplication natively in the linux kernel (through a kernel module). This was Red Hat&amp;#8217;s efforts behind the Permabit acquisition. Considering a virtualization data store is a prime candidate for a de-duplication use-case, I was anxious to reclaim some of my storage budget 🙂 .</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing some troubleshooting in my virtualization environment, specifically with the NFS storage backing it. To isolate an issue I needed to migrate all the VM disks off the main data store to another one. I hadn&amp;#8217;t performed this kind of activity before, but found it to be quite easy.</description>

      <description>By now, most IT staff has either had a chance to deploy OpenStack, or at least are familiar with what it is and what benefits it offers. We&amp;#8217;ve moved past the installer race, the fragmentation of &amp;#8220;as-a-service&amp;#8221; components, and endless TCO calculators. The ecosystem and community has reached a maturity stage where the media and industry alike are calling OpenStack &amp;#8220;boring&amp;#8220;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a little late on this post, but last week we had an excellent presentation on OpenStack installers. Specifically, TripleO. Chris J from Red Hat gave us a good outline of TripleO&amp;#8217;s capabilities, and kept it pretty upstream. For the presentation slide deck, see here. The group tries to keep it as vendor neutral as possible which is nice.</description>

I found a great blog post on how this technology is laid out; that blog post should be all you need to get started. I started by creating a new VM to host both my InfluxDB database, and the Grafana dashboarding service.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;#8217;re on your first or hundredth OpenStack deployment, any administrator will tell you that getting the initial deployment configuration correct is crucial. This gets easier with experience, but what can one do in the meantime to supplement that knowledge? Enter two tools: clapper, and the network isolation template generator.</description>

      <description>For my main workstation, I&amp;#8217;ve been running linux for about 8 or 9 years now and specifically Fedora for the past 3. I&amp;#8217;ve tried to keep my workstation kernel around about the same version as the systems I maintain in the datacentre, typically just slightly ahead. This helps relate my workstation experience to the datacentre, and also keeps me slightly ahead of the learning curve getting experience with the new tools that come in, or figuring out workarounds prior to needing to do them in production.</description>

      <description>Previously, I went through a couple OpenStack topics on installers, and deploying an undercloud as part of a virtual OpenStack deployment. Today I&amp;#8217;ll walk through the overcloud deployment, and hopefully by the end of this post you will have had enough details to get your own deployment up and running. This particular environment is for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8 (Liberty), but the same steps will apply to Mitaka as well.</description>

      <description>When talking TripleO, there&amp;#8217;s two concepts introduced called the &amp;#8220;undercloud&amp;#8221;, and the &amp;#8220;overcloud&amp;#8221;. These are essentially the labels for each OpenStack environment when referring to &amp;#8220;OpenStack on OpenStack&amp;#8221; (TripleO). The undercloud is the OpenStack server that manages and deploys the more publicly consumable overcloud servers that make up the OpenStack environment that we&amp;#8217;re after.</description>

      <description>Building on a previous post, I promised I&amp;#8217;d do a comparison of open source OpenStack installers. Choosing an installer requires more thought than most people think, as the choices are vast, and each installer offers different strengths, benefits, and trade-offs. Depending on your environment&amp;#8217;s purpose and intended result, it would be wise to align your needs with the installers&amp;#8217; capabilities and limitations.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with server/VM provisioning lately and have come across a need to store some basic deployment files in the cloud. For me, these are things like ansible code, a home directory .tar file, among a few other personal items. With ownCloud 9 being recently released, I thought I should give it a try.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;#8217;ve been knocking off a few books that have accumulated on my &amp;#8220;must-read&amp;#8221; list. One of my favourites came recommended by my technical sales professor at SAIT, &amp;#8220;Predictably Irrational, by Dan Ariely. It&amp;#8217;s a New York Times bestseller. It was recommended based on its insights around behavioural science, specifically what factors influence a buyer&amp;#8217;s decision making.</description>

      <description>In our DevOps environment, we&amp;#8217;ve got a lot of developers who regularly build VMs. Sometimes they&amp;#8217;re built locally on their workstations, or sometimes in the data center when they&amp;#8217;re ready to formally move code. Admittedly, the IT VM provisioning process can be slow at times and we often see them get frustrated and take matters into their own hands.</description>

      <description>As my career has evolved over the past 10 years, I’ve come to appreciate the value of collaborative ideas and solutions more than ever. From my early days in software development and QA, into helpdesk, administrator, and architect roles, I’ve seen the best results in every field when we’ve worked closely together to solve problems.</description>
