      <description>Today we had a great presentation from Greg Dekoenigsberg, the Director of Global Open Source Community Relations at Ansible (by Red Hat). With configuration management being such a top topic lately, that sentiment sure was reinforced with the number of attendees we had today &amp;#8211; we filled the room! Greg gave the group a high-level overview of Ansible&amp;#8217;s feature set, along with what the open source community has been seeing for use-cases, and adoption.</description>

      <description>Automation has grown from its traditional roots of simple scripting into a critical cog of present day IT infrastructure. Today we have full fledged software suites based on automation. We have myriads of start-ups who base their entire business model on it. Every CIO is including it in their execution strategy, and you can&amp;#8217;t seem to find a conference that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a trendy buzzword filled keynote dedicated to the topic.</description>
