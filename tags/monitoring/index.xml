      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re a linux enthusiast and you don&amp;#8217;t currently read the LinuxJournal, I suggest you have a look. They&amp;#8217;re a great publication on everything linux, and they regularly provide useful content ranging from reviews, code snippets, how-tos, and tips &amp;amp; tricks. They publish digitally now over a variety of formats, which makes reading very convenient on any device you may have.</description>
