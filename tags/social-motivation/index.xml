      <description>Lately, I&amp;#8217;ve been knocking off a few books that have accumulated on my &amp;#8220;must-read&amp;#8221; list. One of my favourites came recommended by my technical sales professor at SAIT, &amp;#8220;Predictably Irrational, by Dan Ariely. It&amp;#8217;s a New York Times bestseller. It was recommended based on its insights around behavioural science, specifically what factors influence a buyer&amp;#8217;s decision making.</description>

Like probably most of you, I dread the elevator pitch of anyone about to give me a spiel on the latest and greatest industry buzzword topic. Especially if all they did was read an article on LinkedIn.</description>
