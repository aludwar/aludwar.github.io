      <description>Every so often I come across an interesting use-case or a really creative way to integrate different technology that I haven&amp;#8217;t seen before. I follow a few folks on social media and blogs that do this stuff on a regular basis, one of them being Keith Tenzer. He&amp;#8217;s put together a really interesting demo of Ansible Tower connected with GitHub and a webhook that showcases how CI/CD can be accomplished using Ansible without the need for a formal CI/CD pipeline toolset like Jenkins.</description>
