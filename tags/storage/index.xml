      <description>After dropbox ended its support for linux clients, I went looking for a different cloud storage solution to sync data between my linux systems. I ended up purchasing 100GB with Google Drive (now Google One) and also purchasing a linux client that would connect to Google Drive and sync data between the cloud and my linux systems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently been tinkering with a few small Raspberry Pi-like boards. I&amp;#8217;m anxious to get my hands on hardkernel&amp;#8217;s ODROID-H2 x86 board, I think they might have hit a sweet spot for a decently spec&amp;#8217;d, low TDP board with a decent amount of RAM and NVMe storage options. I like the NUC platform, but the H2 might be a less expensive &amp;amp; more capable option.</description>

      <description>In setting up a local virtualization environment a little while back, I thought I&amp;#8217;d try the recently GA&amp;#8217;d VDO capabilities in the RHEL 7.5 kernel. These include data compression and de-duplication natively in the linux kernel (through a kernel module). This was Red Hat&amp;#8217;s efforts behind the Permabit acquisition. Considering a virtualization data store is a prime candidate for a de-duplication use-case, I was anxious to reclaim some of my storage budget ðŸ™‚ .</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing some troubleshooting in my virtualization environment, specifically with the NFS storage backing it. To isolate an issue I needed to migrate all the VM disks off the main data store to another one. I hadn&amp;#8217;t performed this kind of activity before, but found it to be quite easy.</description>

      <description>Once in a while I need to do some I/O benchmarking. Either when creating a baseline for a before and after performance tuning comparison, or just because I want to see how fast my new SSD/M.2 really is. The tool I find myself going to over the years has been iozone.</description>

      <description>Having recently been exposed to some SSD tweaking at work, I thought I&amp;#8217;d do the same with my home PCs.Â Prior to this weekend, I&amp;#8217;ve just had four 1TB SATA drives in a RAID 5 configuration for a disk setup.Â Performance has always been satisfactory, but with recent SSD prices coming down quite a bit, my late 2008 MacBook Pro feeling it&amp;#8217;s age, it was time for an upgrade.</description>
