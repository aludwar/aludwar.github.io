      <description>Building upon the previous article, let&amp;rsquo;s review what we&amp;rsquo;ve built so far:
Deployed a self-managing container OS based on Fedora CoreOS Configured Fedora CoreOS to automatically update itself Setup intelligent health checks and automated rollbacks for any failed updates I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle this first from an upstream approach with Fedora CoreOS, however there&amp;rsquo;s an excellent article written on this same topic for RHEL for Edge by Brian Smith that covers this incredibly well.</description>
