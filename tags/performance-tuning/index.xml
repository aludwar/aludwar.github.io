      <description>In setting up a local virtualization environment a little while back, I thought I‚Äôd try the recently GA‚Äôd VDO capabilities in the RHEL 7.5 kernel. These include data compression and de-duplication natively in the linux kernel (through a kernel module). This was Red Hat‚Äôs efforts behind the Permabit acquisition. Considering a virtualization data store is a prime candidate for a de-duplication use-case, I was anxious to reclaim some of my storage budget üôÇ .</description>

      <description>By now, most IT staff has either had a chance to deploy OpenStack, or at least are familiar with what it is and what benefits it offers. We‚Äôve moved past the installer race, the fragmentation of ‚Äúas-a-service‚Äù components, and endless TCO calculators. The ecosystem and community has reached a maturity stage where the media and industry alike are calling OpenStack ‚Äúboring‚Äú.</description>

      <description>Once in a while I need to do some I/O benchmarking. Either when creating a baseline for a before and after performance tuning comparison, or just because I want to see how fast my new SSD/M.2 really is. The tool I find myself going to over the years has been iozone.</description>

      <description>Having recently been exposed to some SSD tweaking at work, I thought I‚Äôd do the same with my home PCs.¬†Prior to this weekend, I‚Äôve just had four 1TB SATA drives in a RAID 5 configuration for a disk setup.¬†Performance has always been satisfactory, but with recent SSD prices coming down quite a bit, my late 2008 MacBook Pro feeling it‚Äôs age, it was time for an upgrade.</description>
