      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve got an old 17&amp;#8243; Macbook Pro from late 2008 that&amp;#8217;s still kicking. It&amp;#8217;s served me a lot of good years filled with studying, scripting, exams, etc. and I&amp;#8217;ve never had a problem with it. I mostly keep it around for testing OSX related things, and as a backup. Last year I replaced the aging 512GB HDD with a 256GB SSD which did wonders to speed it up.</description>
