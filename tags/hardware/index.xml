      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently been tinkering with a few small Raspberry Pi-like boards. I&amp;#8217;m anxious to get my hands on hardkernel&amp;#8217;s ODROID-H2 x86 board, I think they might have hit a sweet spot for a decently spec&amp;#8217;d, low TDP board with a decent amount of RAM and NVMe storage options. I like the NUC platform, but the H2 might be a less expensive &amp;amp; more capable option.</description>

      <description>In setting up a local virtualization environment a little while back, I thought I&amp;#8217;d try the recently GA&amp;#8217;d VDO capabilities in the RHEL 7.5 kernel. These include data compression and de-duplication natively in the linux kernel (through a kernel module). This was Red Hat&amp;#8217;s efforts behind the Permabit acquisition. Considering a virtualization data store is a prime candidate for a de-duplication use-case, I was anxious to reclaim some of my storage budget ðŸ™‚ .</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing some troubleshooting in my virtualization environment, specifically with the NFS storage backing it. To isolate an issue I needed to migrate all the VM disks off the main data store to another one. I hadn&amp;#8217;t performed this kind of activity before, but found it to be quite easy.</description>

      <description>A few years back, I purged nearly all of my computer components that were kicking around the house, thus essentially abandoning my home lab. I had learned what I needed to with it, and had enough equipment at work to get done what I needed, so off it went. Old PCs, switches, cables, parts, etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve got an old 17&amp;#8243; Macbook Pro from late 2008 that&amp;#8217;s still kicking. It&amp;#8217;s served me a lot of good years filled with studying, scripting, exams, etc. and I&amp;#8217;ve never had a problem with it. I mostly keep it around for testing OSX related things, and as a backup. Last year I replaced the aging 512GB HDD with a 256GB SSD which did wonders to speed it up.</description>
