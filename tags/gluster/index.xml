      <description>A need came up lately for some inexpensive resilient storage that was easily expandable, and that spanned multiple datacentres.Â Having recently been playing with GlusterFS and Swift in our OpenStack trial, I was quick to point out that these were strong use-cases for a GlusterFS architecture. We needed something right away, and something that also wasn&amp;#8217;t terribly expensive, which Gluster caters to quite well.</description>
