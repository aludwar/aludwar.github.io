      <description>Building upon the previous article, let&amp;rsquo;s review what we&amp;rsquo;ve built so far:
Deployed a self-managing container OS based on Fedora CoreOS Configured Fedora CoreOS to automatically update itself Setup intelligent health checks and automated rollbacks for any failed updates I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle this first from an upstream approach with Fedora CoreOS, however there&amp;rsquo;s an excellent article written on this same topic for RHEL for Edge by Brian Smith that covers this incredibly well.</description>

      <description>After a pandemic hiatus, I&amp;rsquo;m back with some renewed vigor to blogging. Over the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve built up several topics that have been stuck in my head and need to get put down to (digital) paper. I think I&amp;rsquo;m finally at a spot with either spare sanity or needing a purposeful distraction that keeps me from doomscrolling the news.</description>

      <description>Recently the merging of Fedora Atomic and CoreOS Container Linux into what is now known as Fedora CoreOS has moved out of preview and is ready for prime time use. I’ve been running a few small container apps on a Fedora Atomic 28 VM, which is now ripe to be moved into the new replacement Fedora CoreOS.</description>

      <description>Every so often I come across an interesting use-case or a really creative way to integrate different technology that I haven’t seen before. I follow a few folks on social media and blogs that do this stuff on a regular basis, one of them being Keith Tenzer. He’s put together a really interesting demo of Ansible Tower connected with GitHub and a webhook that showcases how CI/CD can be accomplished using Ansible without the need for a formal CI/CD pipeline toolset like Jenkins.</description>

      <description>Something Engineering has been working hard on over the past couple of years is connecting Red Hat’s wealth of internal knowledge with items and issues customers face in the real world everyday. Born out of this effort was Red Hat Insights, a predictive analytics engine that analyzes, assesses, and builds automation to remediate issues found in customer environments.</description>

      <description>As we go further in our efforts to automate all the things with ansible, you will likely come across a need to manage some cusom credentials that do not come with a predefined type in Ansible Tower. You might be currently setting these in an environment variable, in group_vars or host_vars, or perhaps hardcoded into a playbook itself.</description>

      <title>Adding python virtual environments (venvs) to Ansible Tower</title>
      <link>https://calgaryrhce.ca/blog/2019/07/19/adding-python-virtual-environments-venvs-to-ansible-tower/</link>

      <guid>https://calgaryrhce.ca/blog/2019/07/19/adding-python-virtual-environments-venvs-to-ansible-tower/</guid>
      <description>As you’re developing playbooks you may find that you need to add additional python capability in order to use some modules. These are easy enough to install on a regular linux client with pip, but how does this work for Ansible Tower? Fortunately this is not too different for Ansible Tower, we’re just going to instruct Tower to add another source directory for our new venvs, and then assign these in Tower at an Organization, Project, or Job Template level.</description>

      <title>Limiting Ansible Tower inventory with Satellite host groups</title>
      <link>https://calgaryrhce.ca/blog/2019/06/13/limiting-ansible-tower-inventory-with-satellite-host-groups/</link>

      <description>When thinking about ingesting systems into Ansible Tower’s inventory, a common use-case is to intelligently filter hosts into Ansible Tower such that we’re selectively adding only the hosts we want into Tower inventory. When pairing with Red Hat Satellite, we can use Satellite’s host grouping feature combined with Ansible Tower’s Satellite 6 dynamic inventory script to apply this filtering.</description>

      <description>I’ve enjoyed Kyle Rankin’s writing for the Linux Journal for several years now. Recently, he presented a topic at FOSDEM 2019 covering the current risk of cloud provider lock in where he draws comparison to the proprietary UNIX wars of the 90s and 00s. He highlights linux and open source software’s immense success during this time, and how everyone benefit from relief of costly proprietary vendor lock-in.</description>

      <title>Create Azure VM with Ansible</title>
      <link>https://calgaryrhce.ca/blog/2019/01/03/create-azure-vm-with-ansible/</link>

      <guid>https://calgaryrhce.ca/blog/2019/01/03/create-azure-vm-with-ansible/</guid>
      <description>With a little googling this task isn’t very complex, however, for those wanting to consume this information easily – this post is for you.
There’s a lot of cloud provisioning tools out there; if you’re like me and prefer to leverage your existing knowledge wherever possible you might come to the conclusion that using the same tool to provision your VMs as you do to manage them makes sense.</description>

      <description>Compliance scanning and remediation with Ansible is a common question that comes up. How does Ansible do this? What are its capabilities? Within the Ansible Galaxy community, there’s been some significant investment in developing ansible roles for security and compliance. I’ll show you how to download this Ansible role and make use of it within Ansible Tower.</description>

      <title>Importing VMs into RHV from KVM</title>

      <description>To import virtual machines from a KVM/libvirt hypervisor into Red Hat Virtualization, is pretty easy. RHV will handle the v2v copying for you in the background, there are just a couple prerequisite steps to take prior to importing. On the RHV hypervisor host you’re proxying the import connection through, setup passwordless SSH from the vdsm user to the root user on the source hypervisor:</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting performance of VDO and NFS</title>

      <description>In setting up a local virtualization environment a little while back, I thought I’d try the recently GA’d VDO capabilities in the RHEL 7.5 kernel. These include data compression and de-duplication natively in the linux kernel (through a kernel module). This was Red Hat’s efforts behind the Permabit acquisition. Considering a virtualization data store is a prime candidate for a de-duplication use-case, I was anxious to reclaim some of my storage budget 🙂 .</description>

      <description>Recently, I’ve been doing some troubleshooting in my virtualization environment, specifically with the NFS storage backing it. To isolate an issue I needed to migrate all the VM disks off the main data store to another one. I hadn’t performed this kind of activity before, but found it to be quite easy.</description>

      <title>Getting the most performance out of Openstack, and NFV</title>

      <description>By now, most IT staff has either had a chance to deploy OpenStack, or at least are familiar with what it is and what benefits it offers. We’ve moved past the installer race, the fragmentation of “as-a-service” components, and endless TCO calculators. The ecosystem and community has reached a maturity stage where the media and industry alike are calling OpenStack “boring“.</description>

      <description>I’m a little late on this post, but last week we had an excellent presentation on OpenStack installers. Specifically, TripleO. Chris J from Red Hat gave us a good outline of TripleO’s capabilities, and kept it pretty upstream. For the presentation slide deck, see here. The group tries to keep it as vendor neutral as possible which is nice.</description>

      <description>I’ve seen some pretty interesting Grafana graphs floating around the interwebs recently and finally made some time to investigate all the hype. I found a great blog post on how this technology is laid out; that blog post should be all you need to get started. I started by creating a new VM to host both my InfluxDB database, and the Grafana dashboarding service.</description>

      <description>Whether you’re on your first or hundredth OpenStack deployment, any administrator will tell you that getting the initial deployment configuration correct is crucial. This gets easier with experience, but what can one do in the meantime to supplement that knowledge? Enter two tools: clapper, and the network isolation template generator.</description>

      <description>Previously, I went through a couple OpenStack topics on installers, and deploying an undercloud as part of a virtual OpenStack deployment. Today I’ll walk through the overcloud deployment, and hopefully by the end of this post you will have had enough details to get your own deployment up and running. This particular environment is for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8 (Liberty), but the same steps will apply to Mitaka as well.</description>

      <description>Building on a previous post, I promised I’d do a comparison of open source OpenStack installers. Choosing an installer requires more thought than most people think, as the choices are vast, and each installer offers different strengths, benefits, and trade-offs. Depending on your environment’s purpose and intended result, it would be wise to align your needs with the installers’ capabilities and limitations.</description>

      <description>So you’d like to get started with OpenStack eh? (Sorry, that’s my Canadian coming through). You may have been thinking about it for a while, evaluating the landscape, the maturity, evaluating your tolerance for new technology, and waiting for the right time to adopt. Being on the verge of adopting a new and disruptive technology is an intimidating place to be.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with server/VM provisioning lately and have come across a need to store some basic deployment files in the cloud. For me, these are things like ansible code, a home directory .tar file, among a few other personal items. With ownCloud 9 being recently released, I thought I should give it a try.</description>
