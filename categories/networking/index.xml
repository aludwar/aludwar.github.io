      <description>In setting up a local virtualization environment a little while back, I thought Iâ€™d try the recently GAâ€™d VDO capabilities in the RHEL 7.5 kernel. These include data compression and de-duplication natively in the linux kernel (through a kernel module). This was Red Hatâ€™s efforts behind the Permabit acquisition.

      <description>Between being busy with home renovations, and writing articles for work, I havenâ€™t made much time for blogging this summer. Since itâ€™s raining today and hampering my home renos, Iâ€™m finally getting to a post on the work I did wiring my house with CAT 6, and setting up a home lab rack in the basement.</description>

      <description>A few years back, I purged nearly all of my computer components that were kicking around the house, thus essentially abandoning my home lab.
