  <p>After a pandemic hiatus, I&rsquo;m back with some renewed vigor to blogging. Over the past two years, I&rsquo;ve built up several topics that have been stuck in my head and need to get put down to (digital) paper. I think I&rsquo;m finally at a spot with either spare sanity or needing a purposeful distraction that keeps me from doomscrolling the news. Either way, there should be some new and interesting content coming out of the backlog.</p>
<p>The first topic I&rsquo;d like to cover is expanding on the changes and maturity we&rsquo;ve seen over the last few years in container technology. We&rsquo;ve seen A LOT of k8s content but not very much container OS content. Yes it&rsquo;s the attractive thing to learn these days, but k8s is complex! What if we have simpler needs or a desire to start somewhere that avoids adding unnecessary complexity?</p>
<p>What if we had a way to add some k8s orchestration and management like capbilities to containerized app deployment without all the k8s complexity? This is what I&rsquo;m going to address in this first topic, divided into a multi-part series:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploying a self-managing container OS based on Fedora CoreOS
<ul>
<li>Are you aware Fedora CoreOS can be configured to automatically update itself?</li>
<li>Did you know we can also setup intelligent health checks and automated rollbacks for any failed updates?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploying a secure, self-healing and auto-updating containerized application with podman and systemd
<ul>
<li>Exploring rootless containers with Fedora CoreOS and podman</li>
<li>Have you seen systemd&rsquo;s capability to auto-start individual containers or a container pod?</li>
<li>What about systemd and podman&rsquo;s ability to update containers automatically?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding a GitOps workflow for managing all of this with code
<ul>
<li>Integration with Ansible for automated initial deployment and future release management</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with a baseline configuration to deploy Fedora CoreOS that will serve as the foundation for this deployment. And if you&rsquo;re wondering, yes the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/li-why-the-os-matters-ebook-f29731wg-202108-en.pdf">OS still matters</a>. (All applications, inclusive of containerized applications, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/architecting-containers-part-1-why-understanding-user-space-vs-kernel-space-matters">rely on the underlying kernel</a>.)</p>
<p>Fedora CoreOS has matured quite a bit over the past 2-3 years since the move from Fedora Atomic. If you&rsquo;ve read a <a href="https://calgaryrhce.ca/blog/2020/02/24/moving-from-fedora-atomic-to-fedora-coreos/">previous article</a> of mine you might already be familiar with the move from Fedora Atomic to Fedora CoreOS. I&rsquo;ll re-use some of what was built before but modified slightly to adapt to the new changes. Particularly around Butane tooling for producing an Ingition configuration file. These technology pieces allow us to define a configuration artifact that Fedora CoreOS will use at deployment time to configure the OS. We can store all OS customization in this configuration for easy re-deployment or scaling up of the OS.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download?tab=metal_virtualized&amp;stream=stable&amp;arch=x86_64">downloading the Fedora CoreOS qcow2 image</a>, I&rsquo;ve built a YAML formatted Butane file and shell script to deploy locally to libvirt. After we get the foundational concepts understood here, I&rsquo;ll later adapt this deployment for cloud in AWS.</p>
<p>The Butane file is YAML, so we&rsquo;ll declare all of our configuration pieces in this file. Before we create the VM we&rsquo;ll need to convert it to an Ignition file, which is JSON formatted, for passing to libvirt at VM creation time. The <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/getting-started/">Fedora documentation</a> for Butane and Ignition is pretty good. For additional details on configuration examples, head over there. I&rsquo;ve done some basic things for my file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specified the root filesystem disk size of 10 GB (Needs to be at least 8 GB)</li>
<li>Set the hostname, static IP networking with DNS details</li>
<li>Configured two files that <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/auto-updates/">setup automatic updating</a> of the OS</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zincati service is the one responsible for automatically updating the OS, via rpmtree. This is the key to having Fedora CoreOS set to automatically update itself once a new version is available, whether that be a new minor build or major release.</p>
<p>You can set a rollout wariness paramater, which specifies how eager the system is to receive new updates. This number goes from 1.0 (very cautious) to 0.0 (very eager). As mentioned in the <a href="https://coreos.github.io/zincati/usage/auto-updates/#phased-rollouts-client-wariness-canaries">docs</a>, the common idea here is to have a few nodes, aka &ldquo;canaries&rdquo;, configured to be very eager to receive updates. These nodes are meant to receive updates as soon as they&rsquo;re available, can afford some downtime, and are specifically monitored to detect issues before the rollouts start affecting a larger fleet of machines.</p>
<p>The other concept at play here is the updates strategy for rebooting machines. Once a new update has been staged, the machine needs to be rebooted in order to apply the update. There are a few <a href="https://coreos.github.io/zincati/usage/auto-updates/#strategies-for-updates-finalization">stratgies</a> for when to take this reboot. The one I&rsquo;ve chosen below is a periodic strategy which allows you to set a maintenance window, and have reboots occur at this time.</p>

      ssh_authorized_keys:
        - "[ publis SSH key hash ]"
      groups: [ sudo, docker ]
</pre>
<p>This is all that&rsquo;s required to provide basic configuration for an OS, and enable it to auto-update itself at a scheduled time with some predictability useful for release management. From there, we convert the Butane file into an Ignition file (you may need to install the Butane utility on your machine, or just pull the container for it):</p>
<pre class="">$ butane --pretty --strict fedora.coreos.bu > fedora.coreos.ign</pre>
<p>And lastly, a virt-install script that will pass the Ignition configuration, Fedora CoreOS qcow2 image, and other parameters to the VM for creation:</p>
<pre class="">$ cat create_coreos_vm.sh
IGNITION_CONFIG="/home/aludwar/fedora.coreos.ign"
IMAGE="/home/aludwar/fedora-coreos-36.20220618.3.1-qemu.x86_64.qcow2"
VM_NAME="coreos.calgaryrhce.ca"
VCPUS="2"
RAM_MB="2048"
STREAM="stable"
DISK_GB="15"

virt-install --connect="qemu:///system" --name="${VM_NAME}" --vcpus="${VCPUS}" --memory="${RAM_MB}" \
        --os-variant="fedora-coreos-$STREAM" --import --graphics=none \
        --disk="size=${DISK_GB},backing_store=${IMAGE}" \
        --network network=default \
        --qemu-commandline="-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=${IGNITION_CONFIG}"
</pre>
<p>At this point you should have a working VM created that&rsquo;s set to auto update itself. Next, we&rsquo;ll look at setting up intelligent health checks and automated rollbacks for failed updates.</p>
