  <p>I was recently asked to outline the options available to do package reporting after a patch cycle for RHEL. There was preference to try to do this in Ansible Automation Platform, consumed via an emailed report, so I&rsquo;ll focus the bulk of the effort there. The specifics were to have view into what packages were installed, updated, removed, etc. as part of a patch cycle. From there, the intent is to list this out and respond to anything that may have failed or done something unexpected during the update. After outlining this I realised that this is a really common question that didn&rsquo;t have much blog coverage on it. So here we go!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of ways to get this info depending on the granularity you&rsquo;re after and the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve for. I&rsquo;ll order them in what I see folks most commonly do, that&rsquo;s also the least amount of re-work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Red Hat Satellite has errata reporting already built-in that will go to this granularity level of reporting packages applied, their status, on a patch cycle. It&rsquo;s located in:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Monitor &ndash;&gt; Report Templates &ndash;&gt; Host - Applied Errata</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually folks will clone the default report template provided here, narrow down the fields/columns that they&rsquo;re after, apply a host filter, etc.  Satellite can mail this to you on a schedule.</p>
<p>If you want to auto-generate the report every time a patch cycle is run, the best way to automate that is with the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.11/html-single/managing_hosts/index#Generating_Host_Monitoring_Reports_managing-hosts">Hammer CLI</a>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Ansible Tower / Ansible Controller has email notifications built-in and with its idempotency already tracked in job output, you don&rsquo;t have to do any extra playbook work necessarily, unless you want some extra metadata in your email body that Ansible Tower/Controller doesn&rsquo;t provide. Sending all this info can get pretty verbose with a lot of hosts &amp; package updates, I find folks don&rsquo;t find email as the best way to consume this information, Tower/Controller GUI Job status output is more nicely formatted and already built for you, but to each their own.</li>
</ol>
<p>Customers typically tend to default to &ldquo;only show me actionable stuff&rdquo; in any Ansible notification, so if for example a patch run that didn&rsquo;t update something is shown instead of all the things that did update successfully.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/aludwar/ansible/blob/master/dnf-report.yml">playbook example</a> that I mocked up and used below. The job output:</p>
<p><img src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note1.png" alt="Note 1"></p>
<p>(You can see that this could get pretty verbose if we wanted to report across multiple hosts)</p>
<p>Next, I created an email Notification that&rsquo;s associated with that Job, the notification parameters can be customized, but as I mentioned above the data available here is more specific to the job than the content results from tasks &amp; hosts.</p>
<p>Ref: <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/notifications.html">Ansible Notifications Docs</a></p>
<p>Ref: <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/notification_parameters_supported.html#ir-notifications-reference">Ansible Notifications Supported Parameters</a></p>
<p>In the success message body below, I configure job metadata that summarizes all hosts and their results, then one that just shows job status counts, ie what changed/failed and folks can click on the job ID link to Tower GUI to dig deeper. I&rsquo;m using my ISP SMTP relay here:</p>
<!-- [<img class="size-large wp-image-822" src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note2.png" alt="" width="1526" height="570" srcset="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note2.png 1526w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note2.png 570w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note2.png 768w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note2.png 1361w" sizes="(max-width: 1526px) 100vw, 1526px" />][6] -->
<p><img src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note2.png" alt="Note 2"></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what it looks like once it shows up:</p>
<p><img src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/note3.png" alt="Note 3"></p>
<p>If you prefer different information here, using the community.general.mail module in a task can get you there.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Red Hat Insights already does all of the above here for you, auditing all systems, tracking errata, identifying vulnerabilities/CVEs that are present on systems, drift analysis, notifications &amp; webhooks, and high-level executive reporting. There&rsquo;s also an API to do some of these pieces in a programmatic fashion.</li>
</ol>
<p>For as granular as an email/report as we&rsquo;re after here though, it might be quicker to use one of the above options. Insights does not yet have customized reporting like Satellite does, it&rsquo;s still in RFE status. And it&rsquo;s a little more dashboard-y/GUI driven answering more high-level questions than what we&rsquo;re afterhere.</p>
