  <p>I&#8217;ve got an old 17&#8243; Macbook Pro from late 2008 that&#8217;s still kicking. It&#8217;s served me a lot of good years filled with studying, scripting, exams, etc. and I&#8217;ve never had a problem with it. I mostly keep it around for testing OSX related things, and as a backup. Last year I replaced the aging 512GB HDD with a 256GB SSD which did wonders to speed it up. This year the battery has finally went on it, so I ebay&#8217;d a <a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/112072784618?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">replacement</a> ($25) from <a href="http://stores.ebay.ca/shopplus86/">plus_86</a>. They&#8217;re a 3rd party battery replacement shop that ships out of Quebec. I also decided to up the RAM from 2GB to 4GB. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m wondering how I ever managed just with 2GB. I had a couple VMs running on this at one time! I ordered a 4GB kit from <a href="http://stores.ebay.ca/memoryfast/">memoryfast</a>, they&#8217;ve got a rebate program where I can ship them my old RAM for a small credit to my order, not bad!</p>

<p>I had a heck of a time replacing the memory. I&#8217;d read this before, but Apple likes to use Loctite 247 on their screws to keep them from vibrating loose. Not a bad idea, until you try to remove them for an upgrade&#8230; I bent a phillips 00 screwdriver trying to get the last one out, then ended up stripping it. I read that Apple techs have a power tool that does this, and I&#8217;m not surprised. After unsucessfully trying a soldering iron and a glue gun to heat up the screw in hopes of loosening the loctite, I ended up drilling out the last screw. I&#8217;m not sure yet if I should be upset that I had to do that, or happy that those design decisions have given me an 8 year old laptop that&#8217;s still kicking. Oh well. At least I didn&#8217;t have to pay an Apple genius to do it for me.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a precision screwdriver kit already, you should get one. They&#8217;re handy for laptop, mobile phone, and other small electronic repairs. I use a basic flat head and phillips kit, with some spare phillips that are slightly smaller in size. For most jobs, you&#8217;ll need the phillips triple zero, double zero, and zero sizes.</p>

<p><a href="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_repairkit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-479 alignnone" src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_repairkit.jpg" alt="precision screw kit" width="800" height="477" srcset="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_repairkit.jpg 800w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_repairkit-300x179.jpg 300w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_repairkit-768x458.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>

<p>Removing the battery at the rear is easy, but as I mentioned that one screw was a pain. The picture quality isn&#8217;t the greatest, but you can see the blue loctite on the screws.</p>

<p><a href="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_open.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-482 alignleft" src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_open.jpg" alt="Laptop rear" width="768" height="479" /></a><a href="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_screws.jpg"><img class="wp-image-481 aligncenter" src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_screws.jpg" alt="loctite screws" width="453" height="472" srcset="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_screws.jpg 872w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_screws-288x300.jpg 288w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_screws-768x800.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></a></p>

<p>Removing the memory is easy-peasey, just push outwards on the metal clasps, and remove the DIMMs at 25 degree angle. This is a shot of them seated:</p>

<p><a href="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_memory.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-480" src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_memory.jpg" alt="Apple Macbook memory" width="800" height="503" srcset="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_memory.jpg 800w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_memory-300x189.jpg 300w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laptop_memory-768x483.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>

<p>And finally, after inserting the new DIMMs, a happy laptop.</p>

<p><a href="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4GBRAM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-483" src="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4GBRAM.png" alt="Upgraded RAM" width="304" height="350" srcset="https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4GBRAM.png 304w, https://calgaryrhce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4GBRAM-261x300.png 261w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></a></p>

<p>Hopefully this laptop lasts another few years. It&#8217;s safe to say it certainly doesn&#8217;t owe me anything 🙂</p>
